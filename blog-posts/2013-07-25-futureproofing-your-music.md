My digital music library was spawned around the time when Limewire was still
edgy and the iPod had just revolutionized portable audio. Like many others, I
took what I could, and ended up with a pretty sizable folder that stuck with me
for years.

When I started to get more serious about my music consumption, I got my first
pair of entry level Audio Technica cans and absolutely loved them. There was
one issue though: that sizable music library consisted entirely of *terribly*
encoded, badly tagged, 96-160 kbps MP3 files. Maybe the odd LAME 320k or V0
interspersed for good measure, just to tantalize with its crisp, airy tones.

Of course, I wanted to fix this as soon as possible so I could start
appreciating my new investment. Fortunately, iTunes had very recently launched
the "iTunes Plus" format, which was DRM-free and 256k AAC--a pretty decent
encoding. Most people (myself included) will tell you that, at reasonable
bitrates, AAC is effectively transparent. To successfully distinguish it from
its original source, you need to have very sensitive hearing and a trained ear.

Well, when my portable music needs were handled by an iPod Mini, I thought the
same. Managing my library and bringing it on the go was effortless, and I could
fit just enough music on that tiny hard drive (yes, it had a hard drive).

However, when I decided I wanted more space, I got a Sansa. This was a while
before the e200v2 had stable Rockbox ports, so I had to transcode those AACs to
clunky MP3s. The thing is, to keep them transparent, my nicely sized files had
to get larger! A *lot* larger! My new player with double the space was now
reduced to carrying marginally more songs.

The reason is that **transcoding from [lossy to lossy] is one of the worst things
you can do to an audio file**--the psychoacoustic models used to make the
compression work start sounding like crap as they layer up and cut out
conflicting parts of the signal.

There's an easy solution though: just don't do it. Starting out with a lossless
source lets you pick your formats later, so you can adapt as encoding
technology evolves or you change hardware.

> *So, the tl;dr is:* keep your library lossless so you'll never again have to worry about transcoding.

Or don't, but please stop complaining that a lossless library is pointless just
because you can't hear the difference. Neither can I.

I've since sent my old music library into the void. The replacement is composed
entirely of lossless sources encoded in FLAC. For portable listening, I
re-encode that library to Vorbis and stick it on my Sansa Clip+ (a great
player). Once there's a better, more efficient lossy format than Vorbis,
migrating will be one or two commands away. Once there's a more efficient
lossless format than FLAC, it'll be just as easy.

If you're struggling to find lossless audio online, don't panic. There are lots
of sources out there: try out your favourite artists' websites (e.g. [NIN]),
[HDtracks], and [Bandcamp]  (awesome for many other reasons).

Or maybe, *just maybe*, order a CD.
