Ever since one of my 2 TB disks started making a wonderful grinding noise, I've
been wanting to set up something a bit more fault-tolerant. With hard drive
prices gradually recovering from the spike a few years ago, I figured it was
finally time to build a big storage system.

This got me thinking though: *why do I want to store so much data?* Services like
[Rdio] and [Netflix] are quickly replacing personal media collections, and they’re
so cheap it seems unreasonable to not use them. Documents and data are rapidly
moving into the globally accessible “Cloud,” making permanent local storage
redundant.

## So, why keep everything around?

Despite the availability of cheap, convenient digital content services, I still
find myself wanting to build up my own collection of digital *stuff*.

There are a few distinct reasons:

### Quality

I like consuming media in the highest quality possible. However, unless there's
a drastic change to how the internet is scaling, the highest available quality
will almost always require greater bandwidth than common connections provide.
It’s also currently uneconomical to stream high quality media when replaying
content, which I find myself doing often if I bothered getting that quality in
the first place.

I like keeping a lossless version of a medium if it’s available. This is most
relevant with music, as lossless formats are easily accessible.

lets me convert to formats with different compression ratios for my portable
player, phone, future toilet, etc., without loss of quality.

### Rarity
I like too many moderately obscure things. Try finding Rasmus Faber’s *Platina
Jazz* or Gui Boratto’s *Chromophobia* on Rdio (hint: I’ve tried). As such services
grow and become more prevalent they’ll increase in coverage, but there will
always be things they don’t have that I want.

### Nostalgia
I like looking back at things I had around 5+ years ago and reliving the
associated moments. If you've ever gone through your old set of video tapes or
physical music, you'll know what I mean.

Obviously this applies to digital video and music, but the neat thing is that
I’ve found the exact same thing applies to arbitrary digital files. Finding the
sprites for a crappy game I made in middle school or research notes for my
first nice kitchen knife is pretty neat, and almost like having all my old
belongings stashed away without taking any physical space.

## Stay Organized
All that said, a library without organization is pretty useless and negates
much of the utility in keeping it around at all.
